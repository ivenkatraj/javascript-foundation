//There are three ways to declare a function

//1. Function declaration
function name(params){
    //statement
}

//2. Function expression
//Defines a named or anonymous function
const name = function (params){
    //statement
}

//3. Arrow function
// shorter function
const name = (params) => {
    //statement
}


//Arrow function most modern way to create js. It doesn't have "this" keyword.
//Function declaration has one advantage that is "this" keyword can be accessed.
